# UnityCastleWallGeneration
Single script used to generate castle objects in unity. Exemplified in this project -> https://blurofficial.itch.io/castle-generator-wall-only

This is one of the more fun side projects I've done, its always nice to see code visualized and that is very much the case here. Procedural Generation is very interesting, I hope I can make more elaborate systems which include that in the future. Meaning, this could be iterated on later.
